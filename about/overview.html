  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p>In a typical chemistry classroom, traditional lab activities are often taught as "cookbook" labs, which does not pay much attention to real world applications. However, understanding chemistry requires a knowledge of the structure of atoms and molecules as well as how they interact in terms of chemical reactions. Observing such details require femtosecond lasers (Zewail A. "Birth of molecules", Scientific Americans,1997). Technological intricacies and expenses involved with femtosecond lasers makes it difficult to be available in typical chemistry classrooms: so, is the need of the virtual laboratory.</p>
