<p>&nbsp;When a light having a transverse Gaussian mode is focused, it generates a harmonic potential field that creates force of the ~pN range that can trap ~ micron sized particles. It has a wide range of applicability starting from physical sciences, biological sciences, chemical sciences etc.</p>
