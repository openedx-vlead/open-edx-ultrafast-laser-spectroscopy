<p>1. Turn on the excitation CW Laser.</p>
<p>2. Place a drop of immersion oil on the oil immersion microscope objective of a specific magnification.</p>
<p>3. Place the microscopic slide of stained live cell on the sample plane.</p>
<p>4. Tighten it with the clamps.</p>
<p>5. Turn on the UV lamp.</p>
<p>6. Move the objective such that the oil placed on it touches the bottom side of the slide.</p>
<p>7. Let the UV light pass through the objective and get focused on the sample (i.e., microscopic slide) and see the fluorescence coming from the stained live cell through the microscope eye piece.</p>
<p>8. Focus the sample seeing the fluorescence of the cell(s).</p>
<p>9. Block the UV lamp.</p>
<p>10. Turn on the FLUOVIEW software for image collection.</p>
<p>11. Fix the power of the excitation Laser beam.</p>
<p>12. Let the excitation Laser beam pass through the microscope objective.</p>
<p>13. Set the value of confocal aperture according to the magnification of the microscope objective (e.g., 40X, 60X).</p>
<p>14. Place proper fluorescence filter (i.e., band pass filter) for selecting the fluorescence coming from the specific region of the cells (e.g., nucleus, microtubules etc.).</p>
<p>15. Turn on the Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT) detector to collect the fluorescence.</p>
<p>16. Increase the PMT voltage to have a good signal.</p>
<p>17. Select the area of the cell to be scanned for getting the image.</p>
<p>18. Click on the �scan once� button getting the image of the live cell sample.</p>
<p>19. Save the image by clicking the buttons in the following order: File I/O&nbsp;=&gt; Save Image as and then select the file type (.TIFF or .BMP) and where to save the image and then click the �save� button to save the image(s).</p>
