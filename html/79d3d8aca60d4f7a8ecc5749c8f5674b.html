<p>As the name suggests, the autocorrelation is the measurement of the pulse using the original pulse itself. Experimentally the original pulse is split in two equal parts and they are again made to recombine both specially and temporally using a variable time delay in one arm. A detector placed at the recombination point detects the interference between two pulses which in turn is converted to the autocorrelation spectrum. Depending on the measurement process this can be of two types- Intensity Autocorrelation and Field Autocorrelation.</p>
<p>Mathematically, autocorrelation function is defined as</p>

<p>This is done using a non-collinear geometry where the two arms are focused to a point using a lens and a BBO is kept at the focal point. At this point the second harmonic generated is proportional to&nbsp;<img src="http://ufls-iitk.vlabs.ac.in/Ultrafast%20files/image004.png" alt="" width="118" height="26" />&nbsp;which is the sum of three components. The third component proportional to&nbsp;<img src="http://ufls-iitk.vlabs.ac.in/Ultrafast%20files/image006.png" alt="" width="93" height="20" />&nbsp;is our desired autocorrelation signal that is detected by the detector as</p>

If we place a BBO crystal in front of the detector and collect only the SHG signal we get the interferrometric (second order) autocorrelation signal as before(look at intensity autocorrelation for mathematical expression).</p>
