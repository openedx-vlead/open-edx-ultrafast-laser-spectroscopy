<p>Femtosecond laser pulses, when focused onto a fluorophore, can generate two-photon fluorescence from the focus only due to its very high peak power. Using this property, femtosecond laser pulses are used in multiphoton microscopy. It has better depth resolution as well as less toxicity compared to the confocal microscopy as here a red shifted light is used for excitation.</p>
