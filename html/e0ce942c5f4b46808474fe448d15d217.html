<p>On tight focusing the harmonic potential, generated by the Gaussian laser beam, attracts the particles towards its focus.&nbsp;For this tweezing action, we need to have&nbsp;microscope objective with Numerical Aperture being greater than 1.2.The ray optics diagram of optical tweezer is given below</p>
