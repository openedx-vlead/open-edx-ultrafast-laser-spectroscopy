<p>1. Turn ON the key Switch (from OFF to ON position).</p>
<p>2. Wait for 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>3. Open the Shutter by pressing the shutter open switch and then press the power level 2&nbsp;switch.</p>
<p>4. Switch on the&nbsp;Chiller.</p>
<p>5. Wait for 40-45 minutes for stabilization of the laser; put a power meter in the optical path to measure the average power of the laser and then remove it.</p>
<p>6. Make the laser from CW to Mode Locked Condition.</p>
<p>7. Put one ultrafast thin Beam Splitter (BS), which divides the total optical path into two parts. One path is call pump path and another is called probe path.</p>
<p>8. Put the Retro on a motorized stage in one path (Probe path) such that the beam height at the input and at the output paths are same &amp; the beam path distances of the input and output paths are same up to 4-5 meter distances. If the beam paths are not parallel then recheck the alignment.</p>
<p>9. Align the laser path according to schematic diagram (Fig: 1).</p>
<p>10. Measure the Optical Path &amp; make sure that the pump and probe path lengths are same, and make the output beam paths parallel (both Pump and probe), If both are not parallel then make it parallel and recheck the alignment properly.</p>
<p>11. Put one Plano convex lens (15 mm) in to the parallel path such that Foci of the pump &amp; probe beams are same.</p>
<p>12. Put one thin BBO (SHG crystal) in to the foci and rotate the BBO such that in the middle of the two beam one extra signal is generated , which is SHG signal, if this signal is absent then move the motorized stage such that the SHG signal is generated, if not recheck the alignment .</p>
<p>13. After SHG generation keep a Photo Diode (PD) into the SHG path and collect the SHG signal through digital Oscilloscope interfaced with GPIB to the computer.</p>
<p>14. Move the Motorized stage and collect the SHG signal, after collecting data fit it into Gaussian and measure the Full width at Half Maxima (FWHM) which is the pulse width of the laser pulse.</p>
