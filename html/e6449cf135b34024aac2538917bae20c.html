<p>Femtosecond laser pulses, when focused onto a fluorophore, can generate two-photon fluorescence from the focus only due to its very high peak power. Using this property, femtosecond laser pulses are used in multiphoton microscopy. It has better depth resolution as well as less toxicity compared to the confocal microscopy as here a red shifted light is used for excitation.</p>
<p>In multiphoton microscope, where mainly two-photon fluorescence is generated and detected, unlike the confocal microscope, no confocal aperture is needed as the two-photon fluorescence is generated only from the focal spot. Moreover, here we can simultaneously excite a whole range of fluorophores using a single laser unlike the confocal microscope as fluorophores have very wide two-photon absorption band compared to its single photon absorption band. The small difference between the multiphoton and confocal microscope is that in the former case we do not need the pinhole, but we need filter (s) to separate the fluorescence coming from the various fluorophores.</p>
