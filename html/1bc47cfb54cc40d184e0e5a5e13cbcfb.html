<p>1. Turn&nbsp;<strong>ON</strong>&nbsp;the key Switch (from OFF to ON position).</p>
<p>2. Wait for 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>3. Open the Shutter by pressing the shutter open switch and then press the&nbsp;<strong>power level 2</strong>&nbsp;switch.</p>
<p>4. Switch on the&nbsp;Chiller.</p>
<p>5. Wait for 40-45 minutes for stabilization of the laser; put a power meter in the optical path to measure the average power of the laser and then remove it.</p>
<p>6. Make the laser from&nbsp;<strong>CW&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;<strong>Mode Locked</strong>&nbsp;Condition.</p>
<p>7. Put one ultrafast thin Beam Splitter (BS), which divides the total optical path into two parts. One path is called pump path and another is called probe path.</p>
<p>8. Put the Retro on a motorized stage in one path (Probe path) such that the beam height at the input and at the output paths are same &amp; the beam path distances of the input and output paths are same up to 4-5 meter distances. If the beam paths are not parallel then recheck the alignment.</p>
<p>9. Put another ultrafast thin beam splitter in the crossing point of the pump and probe beam such that they are fully overlapped in the transmitted and reflected path, if they are not properly overlapped then recheck the alignment properly.</p>
<p>10. Align the laser path according to schematic diagram (Fig: 3).</p>
<p>11. Measure the Optical Path &amp; make sure that the pump and probe path lengths are same. When both the arm are of same lengths then we can see the fringes by putting a white paper after the second beam splitter, if fringes are not visible, recheck the alignment properly.</p>
<p>12. Put one Plano convex lens (15 mm) in to the transmitted path.</p>
<p>13. After checking the fringes pattern keep a Photo Diode (PD) into the optical path and collect the signal through digital Oscilloscope interfaced with GPIB to the computer.</p>
<p>14. Move the Motorized stage and collect the signal, after collecting data fit it into Gaussian and measure the Full width at Half Maxima (FWHM) which is the pulse width of the laser pulse.</p>
