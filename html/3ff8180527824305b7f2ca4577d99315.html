<p>1. Make a through hole on a microscopic slide.</p>
<p>2. On one side of the hole stick a no.1 cover slip (0.13 � 0.17 &mu;m thickness) such that it does not come out easily from the slide. Thus a well is being formed.</p>
<p>3. Get ~ 1 &mu;M concentration of ~1&mu;m diameter polystyrene microsphere coated with fluorophores dispersed in water.</p>
<p>4. Sonicate the sample in (3) for ~ 20 minutes on a bath sonicator.</p>
<p>5. Turn on the trapping Laser.</p>
<p>6. Turn on the �ML� button to convert it to the femtosecond pulse Laser.</p>
<p>7. Place one drop this sonicated said sample in (3) on the well.</p>
<p>8. Place a drop of immersion oil on the oil immersion microscope objective with Numerical Aperture being greater than 1.2.</p>
<p>9. Place the microscopic slide with the sample being placed on the well made onto it on the sample plane.</p>
<p>10. Tighten it with the clamps.</p>
<p>11. Move the objective such that the oil placed on it touches the bottom side of the slide.</p>
<p>12. Let the femtosecond Laser pulses pass through the objective and get focused in the bulk sample (i.e., microscopic slide with the sample being placed on the well made onto it).</p>
<p>13. Fix the power of the Pulsed Laser beam.</p>
<p>14. Turn on the CCD camera to record the trapping event.</p>
<p>15. When the ~1&mu;m diameter polystyrene microsphere coated with fluorophores comes in vicinity of the focus, it feels the optical force field and jumps into the focus and as the microspheres are coated with flourophores, so the trapped microspheres generates the two-photon fluorescence denoting a microsphere is being trapped.</p>
<p>16. CCD camera records the trapping event that is described in process (11).</p>
