<p>In traditional wide field fluorescence microscopy, we cannot get image of high quality for thick specimen. In confocal microscopy, a pinhole is used to get image of the focus by rejecting the out of focus lights, and hence we can have images of better resolution and contrast of thick samples.</p>
