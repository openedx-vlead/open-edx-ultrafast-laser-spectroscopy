<p>&nbsp;There is relationship between time width and frequency bandwidth in every spectroscopic experiments. This time width and frequency bandwidth relationship comes from uncertainty principle, which comes from Fourier Transformation. In daily experimental life, it is used in techniques like FTIR, FTNMR&nbsp;<em>etc.</em></p>
