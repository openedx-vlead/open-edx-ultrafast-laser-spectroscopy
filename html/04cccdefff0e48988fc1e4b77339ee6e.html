<p>The Heisenberg Uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to measure the two conjugate quantities (whose operators do not commute) simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy. As the laser pulse goes onto the shorter and shorter in time domain, it spectral bandwidth goes on increasing. The uncertainty in time and spectrum are related by</p>

<p>Where, ∆t is the time width and ∆ɷ is the spectral width. For the Gaussian shaped pulse, this relation becomes</p>

<p>Now, we cannot measure ∆ɷ directly from our spectrum, as there we have intensity vs. wavelength plot.
