<p>Thermal lens (TL) spectroscopy is based on the photo-thermal effect where energy of a photon, fully or partially, is converted into heat energy. In this spectroscopy, a laser source is used whose wavelength is chosen such that it can couple either with electronic levels or vibration levels of the sample under study. Beside this, energy can be transferred to the sample by scattering but energy transferred to sample, generally, negligible small. So we can neglect this mode of energy transfer mechanism. Energy transferred in the former case, leads the system in the excited state. From there, system can relax to the ground through various mechanism such as&nbsp;radiative&nbsp;(fluorescence and phosphorescence) or non-radiative&nbsp;mechanism. If system relax via non-radiative&nbsp;mechanism, it completely transfer its absorbed energy�&nbsp;to the system in the form of heat while in case of&nbsp;radiative&nbsp;relaxation, some amount of energy is converted in the form of heat due the stokes shift. Because of all these heating mechanism, a spot of local heating is formed. As refractive index of medium is depend on the density and density changes with the change of temperature. All these factors make the local heats to be having smaller refractive index compare to the surrounding. Thermal conduction and convection try to equilibrate the heat generated in the sample and as we move away from the local heated area temperature decreases. In corollary to this, refractive index increases and system behave as Lens. As this lens is formed due to the heating (Thermal) in sample, so it is called Thermal Lens (TL). Also, it is based on light matter interaction, so it is called Thermal lens Spectroscopy.</p>
<p>TL spectroscopy is far more sensitive than the usual absorption based study in order of magnitude. TL spectroscopy depends number of parameters such absorption co- efficient (how strongly the sample absorbed the laser wavelength), thermal conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient, heat capacity, refractive index, thermo-optic coefficient etc.�&nbsp;The principle of TL spectroscopy is shown in fig.1</p>
