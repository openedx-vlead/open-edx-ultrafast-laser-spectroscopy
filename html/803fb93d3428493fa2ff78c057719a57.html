<p>The accurate knowledge of the pulse width of the ultrafast laser pulse is of paramount importance during any experiment in an ultrafast lab. While modern day electronics can not measure any event faster than few Pico-seconds, there are some other state of the art techniques available for characterizing the laser pulses among which Autocorrelation is one of the most efficient techniques which we practice regularly.</p>
