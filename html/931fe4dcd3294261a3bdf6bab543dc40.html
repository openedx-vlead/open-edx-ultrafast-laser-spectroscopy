<p>&nbsp;The whole light coming out of a fluorescent sample is collected in the case of traditional wide filed microscopy whereas, in the confocal microscope, first the image light is focused onto a point (optically conjugate plane of the image), and there a pinhole of proper size is placed to get rid of the light coming from the other portion of the sample and thus getting the image of the focal plane only. Here, first a Continuous Wave (CW) laser light is focused on the fluorescent sample using microscope objective to excite the sample. Then the fluorescence coming from the sample is collected by the same microscope objective. The fluorescence signal is separated through a dichroic mirror and then focused and defocused before it goes to the detector and at that focal point, a pinhole called confocal aperture is placed to remove the fluorescence generating from outside of the focal spot region.</p>
